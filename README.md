# hypervoxel

Thanks for coming to check out our work - please find links to everything we used to imagine and realise this project here.

Here's a link to a web app displaying several examples of emergency and climate related data:
https://hypervoxels.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer3d/index.html?id=6873e562ba5e4ed7a1a4eb9ee3d9558b

These data sets can be packaged for offline distribution and peer caching.

This tool allows conversion of common 3d data formats into very large point based (voxel) datasets.  The client tools include methods for geo-locating data of any kind.  The conversion tool was used to create a proof of concept dataset starting with governemnt data, converted to point cloud.

This tool allows offline caches of geo-data, and an situational awareness system, observation reports, peer to peer data caching, apps accross platforms (ios, androind, windows, linux and web app:
https://github.com/adcura/dynamic-situational-awareness-qt
it uses the arcgis runtime:

Long description here: https://developers.arcgis.com/example-apps/dynamic-situational-awareness/

The Boon local data cache could be built with the following hardware and software:
https://kobol.io/ - open source NAS
https://www.armbian.com/ - operating system for that NAS
https://syncloud.org/ - app installer and maintainer that runs on that OS
https://nextcloud.com/ - self-hosted slack/teams like application suite that is open source and runs on that NAS

The emergency network could consiste of community own and run nodes, using old computers, laptops etc a self-manage community cloud can be built.  This woul dbe a good technology choice for that:
