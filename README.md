# Hypervoxel

# Thanks for coming to check out our work - please find links to everything we used to imagine and realise this project here.

Here's a link to a web app displaying several examples of emergency and climate related data that would be included in the proposed data management infrastructure:
https://hypervoxels.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer3d/index.html?id=6873e562ba5e4ed7a1a4eb9ee3d9558b

_These data sets can be packaged for offline distribution and peer caching._

This tool allows **conversion of common 3d data formats** into very large point based (voxel) datasets.  The client tools include methods for geo-locating data of any kind.  The conversion tool was used to create a proof of concept dataset starting with government data, converted to point cloud.

This tool allows **offline caches of geo-data**, and an situational awareness system, observation reports, peer to peer data caching, apps across platforms (ios, androind, windows, linux and web app:
https://github.com/adcura/dynamic-situational-awareness-qt
it uses the arcgis runtime:

Long description here: https://developers.arcgis.com/example-apps/dynamic-situational-awareness/

Please see the images in this folder for some screenshots of the user interface provided in the sample application.

This tool allows for **citizen reporting** of incidents, observations, we image this component running as a web app always, rather than an installed app, so that anyone can participate at any time:

The Boon local data cache could be built with the following **open source hardware and software**:
https://kobol.io/ - open source NAS
https://www.armbian.com/ - operating system for that NAS
https://syncloud.org/ - app installer and maintainer that runs on that OS
https://nextcloud.com/ - self-hosted slack/teams like application suite that is open source and runs on that NAS

The emergency network could consist of **community owned and operated nodes**, using old computers, laptops etc a self-manage community cloud can be built.  This would be a good technology choice for that:

**Open source networking hardware** can be used to build ad-hoc, field deployed networks in place of existing private network infrastructure, or to support when primary data infrastructure has failed, here is an example of such hardware:

Here is script for that video in case you're unable to listen at 300 words per minute :)

The Hypervoxel team have put together a suite of tools for data visualization and real-time communication for use during emergencies!  We found open source tools that work across platforms, without installing apps, and can survive network outages! Don’t drink the app-driven cool-aid, go offline, get it done in a web browser, everyone’s got one!

You need your data to move around all sorts of devices, not just locked up in big datacentres in the city, what if the line is down! It has happened! Get some cached and offline data into your tech stack, get hypervoxels.

Not just the things we know now, not just 2020 hindsight, but new insights, new streams, new reports, new observations, in real-time, from whoever you want, you wouldn’t believe what’s possible with cost effective, open source tools – no corporate ownership – ever!

Right, so you wanna get the dat from where it is, it’s got the format specified, but it’s inconsistent, and weird and different between sources, and accessed differently, and different permissions for different groups and oh my god what a challenge, but at least try to wrangle it, the good data, the stuff we need, beforehand, make a tool that standardises, make the people with the data use the tool, practice using the tool, during exercises!

A very large set of data can be a description of it myriad components, doesn’t have to be all in the same place, as long as it’s accessible through the same means, The Ark is the descriptor for the entirety of the dataset, it describes where to find what, how to read the data, how to cahce, who has what bit cached, and gives every node a way to cache a new chunk

The Ark is great, now make a mini arc, with just enough data for the area being services, just enough capacity for the environment that it will operate in, load it up before disaster with the static knowledge, the good stuff, useful books, music, maps and historical data, contact details for the locals.  Now pop that in a little box with some amazing open source software, and use that as your local node, head office syncs with this one box, all the other devices sync to this one box, one upstream link to manage, the box can be anywhere, right in the middle of the disaster.  Just think what you could run with a tiny little web server in a box that you’ve shipped out to the event

Right, we need to see our data now, we need it on a map, we need it to make sense, fill my screen with all the stuff.  Whatever device I’m using for situational awareness, management, decision-making, can have all of the data on it, I just need a screenful.  So as a commander, my device connects to the local Boon box, the stream engine picks up the data I’ve asked for and jdishes it up, just the bit I’ve asked for, not the whole dataset, not a copy, just a window, just a view.  

We, the global hacker and data nerd and geo geek community have already built the tools for all of this, now ask yourself why you would want a new app for a disaster, one that needs access to a server far away or overseas always, one that requires a user to be registered with a private company – do you really want Apple or Google to be responsible for preventing a citizen from receiving life-saving information in a timely manner? NO CAPES! I mean NO APPS! Truth is, all of the things we want to do, all the things that need to be done for a system like this to work can be done in a web browser, and every device, my old phone, my new one, my laptop, dads old desktop, mums laptop, all of them have wifi and a web browser, if we build for that, then everyone is catered for, nobody is left out.  Wqeb servers are easy too, guess what the Boon box has in it, a web server, servers up the website, that the people need, with all the data on it, starting to get it?

Here's a bunch of things that we’ve thrown together over a weekend that can solve the problems that we're all talking about, the hardware exists, the software exists, the data is there, when we put the crew together that is responsible for building this, when we fund them, we can have answers to those challenges.  Hypervoxel are proud to present US, the people, the geeks that care, the nerds that can, back this project, help us win, help us get funded for full time work, continuous improvement, exercise, a reserve data force, a real thing that can grow out of a hackathon and serve our community.  We need more than just another app, or just an idea, or just another opportunity for commercial success, we need proper backing.  Everyone participating in Govhack is our team, everyone participating believes they could make a positive difference if given the opportunity.
